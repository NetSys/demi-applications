Aurojit:  i have a question about your edit distance thing
or some comments
but i was being lazy
* I agree with your sentiment about not penalizing removal
in the write up i had a long time ago, i had similarly suggested not penalizing addition
* I wonder if penalizing reordering is necessarily a good idea
we can kind of tell you more about reorderings
there are two types in particular
and the benign kind (these things commute, but the order changed because of the prefix) perhaps does not matter.
* With "unexpected" events, in the cases where we are applyign DPOR, the case of this is that we changed something
and hence new events emerged
i don't know if i necessarily see them as good or bad
so i am not sure about that bit
thus endeth my comments
 me:  ah, interesting point
I agree that we shouldn't penalize reorderings that commute
then again
shouldn't DPOR not explore commutative schedules
?
*or rather, only explore one of them
 Aurojit:  yes
but i guess what i was saying was
if DPOR happens to explore
X Y Z A B C
and they X A B C Y Z
where Y C is not commutative
hence CY was played
and AB needed to be played this way to enable C
if Z doesn't affect things
then we shouldn't penalize its reordering
does this make snese?
 me:  how would we know if Z doesn't affect things?
*that
 Aurojit:  Z is commutative
so let us say
X goes to A
Y goes to B
Z goes to C
A goes to D
ah
hols on
i did bad things
one sec
X is msg receive at actor 1
Y is msg receive at actor 2
Z is msg receive at actor 3
A is msg receive at actor 4
B is message receive at actor 5
C is message receive at actor 2
Z is causally linked to X
as is Y
A -> B -> C is the causal chain on the other thing
in that case
the claim that DPOR is making is that
X Z A B C Y
and X A B C Y Z
are equivalent
the only ordeging we care about is b/w C and Y
does that help at all?
 me:  yeah, I think I basically understand
so, it's almost as if
we want to compute
the longest common subsequence
for every causal chain
then take the union of them
 Aurojit:  yeah
i guess that is close to what i am saying
 me:  and subtract that from the penalty
 Aurojit:  i'd need to think if there is a difference
but yes basically we should account for causality
 me:  right
 Aurojit:  and whether it matters
 me:  that definitely makes sense to me
we could emperically measure whether that makes a difference
 Aurojit:  yeah
i have no evidence
i was just ponitification
*pontificating
 me:  yeah, that's a good point
which I hadn't thought of
