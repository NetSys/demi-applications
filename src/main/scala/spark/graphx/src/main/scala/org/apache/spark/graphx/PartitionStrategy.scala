   *
   * The edge denoted by `E` connects `v11` with `v1` and is assigned to processor `P6`. To get the
   * processor number we divide the matrix into `sqrt(numParts)` by `sqrt(numParts)` blocks. Notice
   * that edges adjacent to `v11` can only be in the first column of blocks `(P0, P3,
   * P6)` or the last
   * row of blocks `(P6, P7, P8)`.  As a consequence we can guarantee that `v11` will need to be
   * replicated to at most `2 * sqrt(numParts)` machines.
   *
   * Notice that `P0` has many edges and as a consequence this partitioning would lead to poor work
   * balance.  To improve balance we first multiply each vertex id by a large prime to shuffle the
   * vertex locations.
   *
   * One of the limitations of this approach is that the number of machines must either be a
   * perfect square. We partially address this limitation by computing the machine assignment to
   * the next
   * largest perfect square and then mapping back down to the actual number of machines.
   * Unfortunately, this can also lead to work imbalance and so it is suggested that a perfect
   * square is used.
