/**
 * :: DeveloperApi ::
 * Applies a [[catalyst.expressions.Generator Generator]] to a stream of input rows, combining the
 * output of each into a new stream of rows.  This operation is similar to a `flatMap` in functional
 * programming with one important additional feature, which allows the input rows to be joined with
 * their output.
 * @param join  when true, each output row is implicitly joined with the input tuple that produced
 *              it.
 * @param outer when true, each input row will be output at least once, even if the output of the
 *              given `generator` is empty. `outer` has no effect when `join` is false.
