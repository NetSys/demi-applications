title: Spark Overview
---

Apache Spark is a fast and general-purpose cluster computing system.
It provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala and Python,
and an optimized engine that supports general execution graphs.
It also supports a rich set of higher-level tools including [Spark SQL](sql-programming-guide.html) for SQL and structured data processing, [MLlib](mllib-guide.html) for machine learning, [GraphX](graphx-programming-guide.html) for graph processing, and [Spark Streaming](streaming-programming-guide.html).

# Downloading

Get Spark from the [downloads page](http://spark.apache.org/downloads.html) of the project website. This documentation is for Spark version {{site.SPARK_VERSION}}. The downloads page 
contains Spark packages for many popular HDFS versions. If you'd like to build Spark from 
scratch, visit [building Spark with Maven](building-with-maven.html).

Spark runs on both Windows and UNIX-like systems (e.g. Linux, Mac OS). It's easy to run
locally on one machine --- all you need is to have `java` installed on your system `PATH`,
or the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable pointing to a Java installation.

Spark runs on Java 6+ and Python 2.6+. For the Scala API, Spark {{site.SPARK_VERSION}} uses
Scala {{site.SCALA_BINARY_VERSION}}. You will need to use a compatible Scala version 
({{site.SCALA_BINARY_VERSION}}.x).

# Running the Examples and Shell

Spark comes with several sample programs.  Scala, Java and Python examples are in the
`examples/src/main` directory. To run one of the Java or Scala sample programs, use
`bin/run-example <class> [params]` in the top-level Spark directory. (Behind the scenes, this
invokes the more general
[`spark-submit` script](submitting-applications.html) for
launching applications). For example,

    ./bin/run-example SparkPi 10

You can also run Spark interactively through a modified version of the Scala shell. This is a
great way to learn the framework.

    ./bin/spark-shell --master local[2]

The `--master` option specifies the
[master URL for a distributed cluster](submitting-applications.html#master-urls), or `local` to run
locally with one thread, or `local[N]` to run locally with N threads. You should start by using
`local` for testing. For a full list of options, run Spark shell with the `--help` option.

Spark also provides a Python API. To run Spark interactively in a Python interpreter, use
`bin/pyspark`:

    ./bin/pyspark --master local[2]

Example applications are also provided in Python. For example,

    ./bin/spark-submit examples/src/main/python/pi.py 10

# Launching on a Cluster

The Spark [cluster mode overview](cluster-overview.html) explains the key concepts in running on a cluster.
Spark can run both by itself, or over several existing cluster managers. It currently provides several
options for deployment:

* [Amazon EC2](ec2-scripts.html): our EC2 scripts let you launch a cluster in about 5 minutes
* [Standalone Deploy Mode](spark-standalone.html): simplest way to deploy Spark on a private cluster
* [Apache Mesos](running-on-mesos.html)
* [Hadoop YARN](running-on-yarn.html)
