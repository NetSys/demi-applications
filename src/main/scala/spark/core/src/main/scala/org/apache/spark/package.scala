/**
 * Core Spark functionality. [[org.apache.spark.SparkContext]] serves as the main entry point to
 * Spark, while [[org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD]] is the data type representing a distributed collection,
 * and provides most parallel operations.
 *
 * In addition, [[org.apache.spark.rdd.PairRDDFunctions]] contains operations available only on RDDs
 * of key-value pairs, such as `groupByKey` and `join`; [[org.apache.spark.rdd.DoubleRDDFunctions]]
 * contains operations available only on RDDs of Doubles; and
 * [[org.apache.spark.rdd.SequenceFileRDDFunctions]] contains operations available on RDDs that can
 * be saved as SequenceFiles. These operations are automatically available on any RDD of the right
 * type (e.g. RDD[(Int, Int)] through implicit conversions when you
 * `import org.apache.spark.SparkContext._`.
