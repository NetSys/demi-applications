/**
 * Represents a RDD from grouping items of its parent RDD in fixed size blocks by passing a sliding
 * window over them. The ordering is first based on the partition index and then the ordering of
 * items within each partition. This is similar to sliding in Scala collections, except that it
 * becomes an empty RDD if the window size is greater than the total number of items. It needs to
 * trigger a Spark job if the parent RDD has more than one partitions. To make this operation
 * efficient, the number of items per partition should be larger than the window size and the
 * window size should be small, e.g., 2.
 *
 * @param parent the parent RDD
 * @param windowSize the window size, must be greater than 1
 *
