Hey Nick and Eric,

I set up DEMi so that it should be easy for you to add in your logic.
There is some skeleton code for your class in
minimification/internal_minimization/StateMachineRemoval.scal.

I made two branches on the demi-applications repository you can start with:
  - raft-58-state-machine [start with this one]
  - raft-42-state-machine [more difficult case; my naive strategy takes a long
    time to finish]

Your minimizer is currently called *after* my dumb approach ("Remove one event
at a time, see if the violation is still there". Line 267 of
RunnerUtils.scala). So in some cases, there might not be much left for you to
minimize (although, there is still room for minimization in
raft-58-state-machine and raft-42-state-machine).

To evaluate your approach:
  - Run the code once with your minimizer turned on.
  - Comment out lines 277-286 of RunnerUtils.scala and recompile [or if you want to be
    fancy, add a command line flag to Runner.scala so you don't have to
    recompile]
  - Look at....

Thanks!
-Colin
