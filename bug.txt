TODO(cs): need to reset Worker.idGenerator upon replay!!

TODO(cs): submitting jobs requires you to run *code*, not just send a message.
Need a new external event that runs a piece of code at a particular point of
time.

- How to submit tasks with different prefs? (do I need to submit multiple
  jobs?)
  - how are execIds specified?

- TODO(cs): occasionally doesn't fuzz properly. See no_start_properly.txt
