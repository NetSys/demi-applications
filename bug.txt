TODO(cs): submitting jobs requires you to run *code*, not just send a message.
Need a new external event that runs a piece of code at a particular point of
time. Notes:
   - Can be done synchronously, i.e., don't need a separate thread
   - SparkContext.submitJob does cause a message to be sent. Need to treat
     this as an external thread, even though its name is akka-dispatcher
   - I don't think we need AtomicBlocks.
   - need to reuse the same SparkContext

TODO(cs): source of non-determinism: scheduler.schedule(block)
